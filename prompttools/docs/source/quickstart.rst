Quickstart
===========

To install ``prompttools``, you can use ``pip``:

::

   pip install prompttools

You can run a simple example of a ``prompttools`` locally with the following

::

    git clone https://github.com/hegelai/prompttools.git
    cd prompttools && jupyter notebook examples/notebooks/OpenAIChatExperiment.ipynb

There are many `notebook examples <https://github.com/hegelai/prompttools/tree/main/examples/notebooks>`_ that
you can explore. The README on that page gives you brief description of the examples.

If you prefer to have a UI instead of using jupyter notebook, have a look at
our `Playground <./playground.html>`_.
